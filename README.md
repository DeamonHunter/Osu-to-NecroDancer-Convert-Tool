*Changelog*
3 

-Added TagLib. A library to deal with music files and their metadata. 

-Optimised the program (mainly due to TagLib). Lost the ability to stop at the last 'note'. Should now handle really long songs a lot faster.

-Removed the manual editor, it was only creating problems and bloat.

-Program now asks you where you want the files to be upon first load.

2.1 Fixed a crash concerning trying to convert a double to int.

2 Added a manual editor

1.2 Added ability for multiple types of conversion

1.1 Small Changes

Added a checkbox to show the Debug window. You now no longer have to close these whenever you do more than one song.

Added a check that whenever you change the file to load, that it will lock out the Convert Button, to avoid misnaming files

Added ALOT of Comments.
